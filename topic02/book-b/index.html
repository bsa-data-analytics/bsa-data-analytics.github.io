        <h1>Objectives</h1>
<p>This lab will focus on how to effectively summarise data quantitatively and perform some basic analyses for useful managerial information and insight. You will also cover measures of association and the use of histograms, box plots and scatter plots.</p>

      </div>
     
      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="01">
        <h1>Descriptive Statistics</h1>
<p>The Excel file - <a href="./archives/facebook-survey.xlsx">facebook survey</a> provides data from a sample of students abou their Facebook habits. The data include categorical variables for gender and number of view/day, and numerical variables for the number of hours spent online/week and their estimated number of friends.</p>
<p>We might want to get a &quot;big picture&quot; view of what the data tells us. For example we might want to determine what is the typical number of friends, if any differences exist by gender, or how the number of views/day might be related to the number of friends. </p>
<p>Statistical measures provide an effective and efficient way of obtaining meaningful information from data.
Descriptive statistics refers to a collection of quantitative measures and ways of describing data. This includes measures of central tendancy (mean, median, mode, proportion), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and frequency distributions and histograms.</p>
<p>Excel provides statistical functions as well as an analysis toolpak for more complex computations.</p>
<p>Some of the functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>AVERAGE(data range)</li>
<li>MEDIAN(data range)</li>
<li>MODE.SNGL(data range)</li>
<li>MODE.MULT(data range)</li>
<li>VAR.S(data range)</li>
<li>VAR.P(data range)</li>
<li>STDEV.S(data range)</li>
<li>STDEV.P(data range)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequency Distributions, Histograms</h2>
<p>A frequency distribution is a table that shows the number of observations in each of several nonoverlapping groups. We may construct frequency distributions for both categoricl and numerical data.</p>
<h3>Categorical Data</h3>
<p>Categorical variables naturally define the groups in a frequency distribution; we need only count the number of ovservations that appear in each category. For the Facebook survey data for example, we may count the number of students who access Facebook 1-5 times, 6-10 times, and so on, using the Excel COUNTIF function.</p>
<p>For instance to count the number of students who view facebook 1-5 times a day, use the function </p>
<pre><code>=COUNTIF($C$4:$C$36,&quot;1-5&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>A frequency distribution for this categorical variable is shown below.</p>
<p><img src="./img/01.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Write the necessary COUNTIF formulas to present the data as above.</p>
<p>You can then construct a column chart to represent the frequencies.</p>
<p><img src="./img/02.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also express the freqencies as a fraction or proportion of the total; this is called a relative frequency distribution as below:</p>
<p><img src="./img/03.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Thus the relative frequency of 1-5 views/day is calculated at 9/33=0.273. The sum of the relative frequencies must total 1.0</p>

      </div>
     
      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="02">
        <h1>Descriptive Statistics cont&#39;d</h1>
<h2>Numerical Data</h2>
<p>For numerical data that consist of a small number of discrete values, we may construct a frequency distribution similar to the way it was done for categorical data, that is simply count the frequencies of each discrete value. For example, in the facebook data, all the numbers of hours online/week are whole numbers between 2 and 15. </p>
<p>Construct a frequency table for the hours online per week using the COUNTIF function as before. </p>
<p><img src="./img/06.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Create a column chart for the frequency values.</p>
<p><img src="./img/07.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A graphical depiction of a frequency distribution for numerical data in the form of a column chart  is called a histogram. Frequency distributions and histograms can be created using the analysis toolpak in Excel.You should have the analysis toolpak loaded into Excel. To check, go to the File tab in Excel, choose Options, and then Add-Ins, in the Manage box select Excel Add-Ins, Click Go. In the Add-Ins available box select Analysis Toolpak check box and click OK.</p>
<p>For numerical data that have many different discrete values with little repetition or are continuous, a frequeny distribution requires that we define groups (called bins), by specifying the number of groups, the width of each group, and the upper and lower limits of each group. It is important to remember that the groups may not overlap so that each value is counted in exacltly one group.</p>
<p>Add a column to the Facebook data that contains the bin ranges for Friends. Using these values, we are placing each value of Friends into groups from 0 to 50, more than 50 and up to 100, more than 100 up to 150 and so on.</p>
<p><img src="./img/08.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next click on the Data tab in Excel you should see the Data Analysis button.</p>
<p><img src="./img/05.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Choose Histogram, select the range of values to be used, in this case it is the values in the Friends column (E4:E36). Choose the Bin values to be the new values you entered for the bin ranges (F4:F13).
Make sure you check the Chart output box.</p>
<p><img src="./img/09.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A histogram with bin range and frequency values will be generated in a new sheet.</p>
<p><img src="./img/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The histogram shows that we have 5 occurences with below or equal to 50 friends, nine greater than 50 and less than or equal to 100 and so on. The histogram shows that fewer students have large numbers of friends and that most have 200 or less.</p>
<p>As previously done we can add a relative frequency column so as to add more context to the values you are analysing. </p>
<p><img src="./img/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can also sum all the relative frequencies at or below each upper limit, this is called the cumulative relative frequency. The cumulative relative frequency represents the proportion of the total sample that falls at or below the upper limit value.For example we can see that 0.697 or 70% of students have 200 or less friends on facebook.</p>
<p><img src="./img/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that as relative frequenies must be between 0 and 1 and must add up to 1, the cumulative relative frequency for the last group must be equal to 1.</p>
<p>Next you can create a chart for the cumulative relative frequency, called an ogive. From this chart you can easily estimate the proportion of observations that falls below a certain value. </p>
<p><img src="./img/13.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Exercise:</h2>
<p>Construct frequency distributions and histograms for the numerical data in the excel file <a href="./archives/cell-phone.xlsx">cell-phone.xls</a>. Also, compute the relative frequencies and cumulative relative frequencies. Plot the cumulative relative frequenices on a line chart.</p>

      <div  class="ui tab segment lab" data-tab="03">
        <h1>Measures of Association</h1>
<p>Two variables have a strong statistical relationship with one another if they appear to move together. We see examples on a daily basis; for instance, attendance at baseball games is often closely related to the win percentage of the team, and ice cream sales likely have a strong relationship with daily temperature.</p>
<p>When two variables appear to be related, you might suspect a cause-and-effect relationship, sometimes however, statistical relationships exist even though a change in one variable is not caused by a change in the other. For example the New York Times reported a strong statistical relationship between the golf handicaps of corporate CEOs and their companies stock market performance over three years. CEOs who were better than average golfers were likely to deliver above average returns to shareholders. Clearly, the ability to golf would not cause better business performance. One must be cautious in drawing inferences about causal relationships based soley on statistical relationships.</p>
<p>However the relationship between variables is extremely important in making good business decisions.</p>
<p>Using the stockPrices excel file we used in lab02 we will investigate the relationship between the S&amp;P stock prices and Duke Energy stock prices.</p>
<p><a href="./archives/stockPrices_lab2_solution.xlsx">stockPrices</a></p>
<p>We look at two columns of data at the same time using functions to work on ordered pairs. Our X axis values are the S&amp;P index and the Y axis are Duke Energy stock for the same month. Each ordered pair represents one month in time and two results.</p>
<p>We would lke to know what is the best fit line that fits that data, if they are perfectly correlated there will be a steep line, if there is little correlation there will be a flat line. </p>
<p>In these steps we place Duke Energy as the known y&#39;s and so we report on Duke Energy&#39;s relationship with S&amp;P</p>
<p>To find the slope of the line we use the slope function.</p>
<pre><code>
    =slope(E4:E178,D4:D178)</code></pre>
<p><img src="./img/42.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next we would like to know on average did Duke Energy stock out perform the S&amp;P index. One way to discover this is what would be the return from Duke Energy if the S&amp;P index returns zero? For this we use the Y-intercept function.</p>
<pre><code>
=intercept(E4:E178,D4:D178)</code></pre>
<p><img src="./img/43.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The outcome is slightly positive which tells us over the 14 years Duke Energy on average would return half a percent if the S&amp;P returned zero.</p>
<p>The descriptive statistics of min, max, mean and stardard deviation tell us these values move differently. But how differently? Are they always up together or down together, does Duke Energy always move up more independently?</p>
<p>For this we use the correl function.</p>
<pre><code>
=correl(E4:E178,D4:D178)</code></pre>
<p><img src="./img/44.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see it is positive but not strong. This tells us the Duke Energy stock goes it&#39;s own way independently of the market. It can be interpreted as a good thing as it is beneficial to have assets that are not highly correlated to each other.</p>
<p>The correlation between the SP500 and Duke Energy Stock shows there is a relationship that is significant but not overwhelming. There&#39;s a lot of independent movement too. This tells us that Duke Energy goes its own way, it is often down when the overall stock market is up and and it goes up when the overall stock market is down.
For a well performing stock this is a desirable characteristic as it allows greater diversification by having assets that are not highly correlated to the stock market as a whole.</p>
<p>Correlation is a measure of a linear relationship between two variables, X and Y, and is measured by the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient is between -1 and +1
A correlation of 0 indicates that two variables have no linear relationship to each other. Thus, if one changes, we cannot resonably predict what the other variable might do. A positive correlation coefficient indicates a linear relationship for which one variable increases as the other also increases. A negative correlation coefficient indicates a linear relationship for one variable that increases while the other decreases.</p>
<p>You can also calculate the R-Squared value for the relationship between the S&amp;P 500 and Duke Energy by using the RSQ() formula. Again enter the known y&#39;s as Duke Energy.  R Squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination. </p>
<p>R-squared is always between 0 and 100%:</p>
<ul>
<li>0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.</li>
<li>100% indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.</li>
<li>In general, the higher the R-squared, the better the model fits your data</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./img/47.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The R-squared for S&amp;P 500 and Duke Energy shows the relationship between the stocks explains only 11% of the variability around the mean.</p>
<h2>Scatter charts</h2>
<p>For the S&amp;P and Duke stock prices file, select both columns D and E. Then go to the Insert Tab and from the charts section choose Scatter. In a scatter chart each dot represents one month&#39;s activiity. the x axis represents the returns of S&amp;P 500, and the y axis represents the returns of Duke Energy Stock.</p>
<p>A scatter plot chart is created for the data showing some association but not a high amount of association (you will cover more on association in lab4)</p>
<p>We can add descriptive statistics by choosing trendline linear from the charts design tab.</p>
<p><img src="./img/46.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A dotted line will appear. Now go back to the trendline menu and choose options, next check the box to display the equation on the chart and check the box to display the R-Squared value on the chart.</p>
<p>The equation may be a little small (you can click on the equation and move it to a better position on the chart if it is difficult to read) but if you can see it, it states Y=0.4863x + 0.0051. This means the slope is 0.4863 which is what we found before. The y-intercept is 0.0051 as we found before.</p>
<p><img src="./img/45.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Excel file <a href="./archives/colleges_universities.xlsx">Colleges and Universities</a> contains data from 49 top liberal arts and research universities across the United States. Several questions might be asked about statistical relationships among these variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a higher percentage of students in the top 10% or their high school class suggest a higher graduation rate?</li>
<li>Is acceptance rate related to the amount spent per student?</li>
<li>Do schools with lower acceptance rates tend to accept students with higher SAT scores?</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions can be addressed by computing the correlation between the variables.
The correlation matrix for the data in Colleges and Universities is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="./img/38.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Excel&#39;s CORREL function computes the correlation coefficient of two data arrays, and the data analysis correlation tool computes correlation coefficients for more than two arrays.</p>
<p>None of the correlations are very high; however, we see a moderate positive correlation between the graduate rate and SAT score (0.56414), this indicates that schools with higher SATs have higher graduation rates.
We also see a negative correlation between acceptance rate and graduation rate (-0.55037751), indicating that schools with lower acceptance rates have higher graduation rates.</p>
<p>Open the <a href="./archives/major_league_baseball.xlsx">major league basball</a> and calculate the correlations between some pairs of numerical variables. Do the results make sense?</p>

        <h1>Visual display of statistical measures</h1>
<h3>Box Plots</h3>
<p>Box plots graphically display five key statistics of a data set - the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and the maximum. They are very useful in identifying the sahpe of a distribution and outliers in the data.
Box plots can be created in Excel using PHStat. </p>
<p>Download PHStat2 for your own laptops if you havent already done so. </p>
<p><a href="./archives/PHStat_4.0.zip">PhStat2</a></p>
<p>Using the facebook data, choose PHStat menu in the add-Ins tab and choose descriptive statistics, then boxplot, select the data for facebook friends including the column heading. Check single group variable, enter a title in the output options and tick five number summary box. Click Ok. A new worksheet contains the five numbers (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum) and another worksheet contains the box plot diagram.</p>
<p><img src="./img/40.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The &quot;whiskers&quot; on either side of the box represent the maximum and minimum values, and the box encloses the first and third quartiles with a line inside the box representing the median. Very long whiskers indicate outliers in the data. Since the box is off centre to the left and the median line is off centre within the box, the distribution appears to be positively skewed (this was verified by the CS calculated earlier).</p>
<h3>Dot-Scale Diagrams</h3>
<p>A dot-scale diagram is another visual display that shows a histogram of data values as dots corresponding to individual data points, along with the mean, median, first and third quartiles, and +- 1, 2, and 3 standard deviation ranges from the mean. </p>
<p>The Facebook friends data can be used to generate a dot-scale using the PHStat descriptive statistics menu again.</p>
<p><img src="./img/41.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Dot-scale diagrams provide a better visual picture and understanding of the data than box plot.</p>
<p>Construct a box plot and dot-scale for the data in <a href="./archives/vacation_survey.xlsx">vacation survey</a></p>
<h2>Outliers</h2>
<p>Earlier we had noted that the mean and range are sensitive to outliers in the data. Outliers can make a significant difference in the results we obtain from statistical analyses. An important statistical question is how to identify them. The first thing to do from a practical perspective is to check the data for possible errors, such as a misplaced decimal point. </p>
<p>Box plots and dot-scale diagrams can help identify possible outliers visually. The question is what to do with them. They should not be blindly eliminated unless there is a legitimate reason for doing so. Statisticians often suggest that analyses should be run with and without the outliers so that the results can be examined critically.</p>
